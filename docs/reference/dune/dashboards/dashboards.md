**Balancer Labs' data team** has been diligently working on rebuilding our Dune dashboards. The goal is to provide enhanced cross-chain analysis and more customizable filters.

The rebuilt Dune dashboards will offer users the ability to perform in-depth analysis with improved filters and cross-chain analysis.

Any feedback on the dashboards is greatly appreciated and can be provided by filling out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHCgRxCGfyJp02Dl_nK6shDnXY1FDDXpsd-sqjTeIsv5EteQ/viewform) or by directly reaching out to us on [discord](https://discord.balancer.fi/).
